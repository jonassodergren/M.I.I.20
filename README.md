>**A Mydata reference implementation project**

## What do we want to do - and why?

  We aim to create an open source standard on giving and revoking consent while data-charing/circulating from an individual point of view. The goal is to state a technical standard regarding consent and revoke that can be used by anyone.

We have seen other initiatives using specific data e.i. cv-data. Our project is data independent - general. We think the benefit for society is if we travel FROM CUSTOM TO GENERAL, we want one solution to rule them all.

  We will build this project on the fundamentals of the MyData Declaration. This declaration contains three major principles:

1.  Human-centric control of personal data
    
2.  Individual as the point of integration
    
3.  Individual empowerment
The focus of this project will be on the Human-centric control of personal data that will empower individuals to give, deny or revoke their consent to share data based on clear understanding of why, how and for how long their data will be used.

## Background Mydata

MyData is:

-   An infrastructure-level approach for ensuring data interoperability and portability – open infrastructures make it possible for individuals to change service providers without proprietary data lock-ins
    
-   Sector independent – there is currently significant progress being made in individual sectors, such as health and finance, but a cooperative approach could work across all sectors
    
-   Consent-based data management and control – it is not necessary for the individual to store all his/her data in centralized repositories in order to control the data flow
    

MyData is focused on consents because:

-   consents are the primary (but not the only) legislative framework that defines information processing from the human-centric perspective
    
-   the same consent management framework can also be used with minor modification for notifications and assignments
    
-   human and machine readable standardized consents unite technical data management systems, legislative frameworks, and the human perspective
